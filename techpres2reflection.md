#### Technical Review 2 Reflection

### Feedback and Decisions

The survey that we used to get feedback from our peers gave us direction for the next phase of implementations. Since we have many ideas that we want to include, this was helpful in focusing our efforts. Going forward we plan to implement a tutorial, slider for area and tangents, inflection point interaction and “nudging” curve adjustment. We may also implement the option to use arbitrary colors with OpenCV. 

### Review process reflection
The process went pretty well as everyone were engaged in playing with the code and they found many bugs for us to fix. The survey method worked well as we were able to get feedback from everyone without peer influence. We sticked close to our agenda.
