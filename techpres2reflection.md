#### Technical Review 2 Reflection

The survey that we used to get feedback from our peers gave us direction for the next phase of implementations. Since we have many ideas that we want to include, this was helpful in focusing our efforts. Going forward we plan to implement a tutorial, slider for area and tangents, inflection point interaction and “nudging” curve adjustment. We may also implement the option to use arbitrary colors with OpenCV.
