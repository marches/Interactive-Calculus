Survey and feedback	


We will communicate with our audience in a couple ways. First, we will use slides as visual aids. Second, we will demonstrate our code on the projector, and interactively show how it works and what decisions we are facing. Finally we will ask our peers to download and play with our code, and fill out a short paper survey at the end.
