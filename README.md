### Interactive Calculus

#### Description
The main idea of our project is to create a interactive math app that helps individuals understand calculus. The purpose of this project is to allow the user to interact with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in a purely visual and geometric way, eliminating equations and allowing the user to build a geometrically intuitive understanding of the theorem. 

#### Getting started
This module requires the installation of scipy, numpy, OpenCV, and pygame. 

To install these in a linux system:
  `$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame`
  
 ` $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv`
  
 ` $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy`

To install these in a windows system:

pygame:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

opencv-python:
http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0

scipy and numpy:
http://www.numpy.org/

#### Usage
To use the program, run main.py.

Input:
Draw with you mouse by clicking and moving it across the screen. 
Draw with open cv by pressing space, moving a tennis ball in your hand, and pressing space again when you are done. 

Features:
Click and dragging the curves to see how the derivative and integral change.

Press 't' to see tangent lines.
