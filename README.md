### Visual Calculus

#### Description
This project aims to help individuals understand and interact with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in a purely visual and geometric way. We hope to help learners build an intuition for the relationships among a line and its corresponding derivative and integral through an interactive window where users begin by drawing an input curve. Afer the curve is drawn, it's corresponding integral and derivative are displayed and users may adjust these lines and observe how they change in relation to one another. Users may also view corresponding tangent lines and areas to connect the functions of derivatives and integrals to their properties as lines. We hope this module will act as a supplement to traditional textbook explanations and will be a userful tool for both teachers and learners.

#### Getting started
This module requires scipy, numpy, OpenCV, and pygame. 

To install these in a linux system use:

 ` sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pygame python-opencv`
 
To install these in other operating systems visit:

Pygame:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

OpenCV:
http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0

Scipy and numpy:
http://www.numpy.org/

#### Usage
To use the program, run main.py.

`  python main.py`

Toggle on the draw button in the bottom left corner to begin. Click once to begin drawing and again to stop. From there, use the buttons to view tangent lines, critical points and more. Toggle on the camera button to draw a curve using webcam. (A tennis ball will work best.) 

Keyboard shortcuts: 
't': Turn on/off show tangents
'a': Turn on/off show area under curve
'c': Turn on/off show critical points
'h': Turn on/off legend
'g': Turn on/off grid
Space: draw with open CV and stop drawing
Right click: clear screen

##### Known Bugs
Open CV calibration does not work.
