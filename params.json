We hope to help learners build an intuition for the relationships among a line and its corresponding derivative and integral through an interactive window where users begin by drawing an input curve. Afer the curve is drawn, it's corresponding integral and derivative are displayed and users may adjust these lines and observe how they change in relation to one another. Users may also view corresponding tangent lines and areas to connect the functions of derivatives and integrals to their properties as lines. We hope this module will act as a supplement to traditional textbook explanations and will be a userful tool for both teachers and learners.\r\n\r\n#### Getting started\r\nThis module requires scipy, numpy, OpenCV, and pygame. \r\n\r\nTo install these in a linux system use:\r\n\r\n ` $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-opencv python-pygame`\r\n\r\nTo install these in other operating systems visit:\r\n\r\nPygame:\r\nhttp://www.pygame.org/download.shtml\r\n\r\nOpenCV:\r\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0\r\n\r\nScipy and numpy:\r\nhttp://www.numpy.org/\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\nTo use the program, run main.py.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nDraw with you mouse by clicking and moving it across the screen. \r\nDraw with open cv by pressing space, moving a tennis ball in your hand, and pressing space again when you are done. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nClick and drag the curves to see how the derivative and integral change. \r\nPress 't' to see tangent lines. \r\n\r\n#### Authors\r\n[Matthew Beaudouin-Lafon](https://github.com/MatthewBeaudouinLafon), [March Saper](https://github.com/mesrumpled), [Xiaoxheng Xu](https://github.com/xiaozhengxu) \r\n\r\nAttribution to http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/ for Open CV object tracking.\r\n\r\n#### License\r\nRefer to  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nCopyright (c) [2016] [Contributors above]\r\n",
